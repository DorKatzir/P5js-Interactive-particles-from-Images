# P5js-Interactive-particles-from-Images
Interactive particles made from pictures! Turn an image into an interactive art piece with these particles.
The particles we make in this video are very versatile, you can play around with how strong the attraction/repulsion forces are, what they are repelled and attracted to, and even experiment with how you place them on the screen (maybe try using text or sound!).
